## Project Description
> Ski Lyft is a mobile application that allows skiiers and boarders to hitch a ride with on the way to and from the mountains.

## Problem statement
> Have you ever wanted to go skiing but, wished you could split the cost of gas with someone else?  Do you love the environment and wish more people would share rides to and from the slopes?  Do love to shred but, hate traffic?

## How will your project solve this problem?
> Ski Lyft users can schedule rides to and from the slopes thus, eliminating traffic, making the ride more affordable and being more environmentally conscious.  We do this by creating a mobile app that allows users to find others to share their ride with to and from the mountain.
